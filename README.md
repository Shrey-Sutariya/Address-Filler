# Address Filler

The Address Filler project aims to develop a highly efficient and accurate system for **automatically** filling in address information. In many online forms and applications, users are required to enter their addresses manually, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. The Address Filler project aims to streamline this process by automating the retrieval and population of address details based on minimal user input.

The primary goal of the Address Filler project is to enhance user experience by reducing the effort required to complete address fields accurately. By automating the process, users will be able to complete forms faster, minimize errors caused by manual entry, and avoid frustrations associated with address-related issues. The system will be designed to integrate seamlessly into various applications and platforms, including e-commerce websites, online registration forms, delivery services, and more.
